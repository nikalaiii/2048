---🛠️ TECHNOLOGIES USED---

JavaScript (Vanilla JS): 

--> Handles all game logic: generating numbers, tile movement, merging, and game over conditions

--> Dynamically updates the DOM based on the current game state

--> Listens to keyboard events to control player moves

HTML/CSS:

--> Provides the game structure and base styling

--> Ensures accessibility and semantic layout

--> Includes smooth transition effects for UI interactions

SASS (SCSS):

--> Organizes styles using variables, nesting, and mixins for better readability and maintainability

--> Enables easy color and layout management for different tile values

--> Helps create responsive and scalable design

Gulp:

--> Automates project build tasks such as compiling SCSS to CSS, minifying files, and live reloading

--> Improves development workflow and code quality

--> Manages asset optimization and file structure for deployment
